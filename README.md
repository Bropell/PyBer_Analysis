# PyBer_Analysis
## Project Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to use the power of Python, Pandas and Matplotlib to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. A multiline graph was generated to show the weekly fares for each city type do that better decisions can be made at PyBer.

As seen in the image above regarding ride-sharing data by city type, there are several take away points. The indices are ordered from smallest to largest in terms of city size. The data in the first three columns show an increase in total rides, total drivers and total fares respectively as the size of the city increases. This makes sense because larger cities have more people, which means more people in need of a ride, more drivers are needed to transport those people, and more funds are generated as a result. Conversely, the average fare per ride and driver shows a decrease as the city size increases. This is due to a larger ratio between the fare and rides or drivers for the smaller city types.
